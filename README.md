### 🐞 3. Debug Your JavaScript

If you’re facing bugs:
- Use `console.log()` to trace values
- Open **DevTools** (F12) → go to **Sources** → set breakpoints
- Use the `debugger` keyword in your code to pause execution

Example:
```javascript
function checkCart() {
  debugger;
  console.log("Cart checked");
}
